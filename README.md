##

The pedagogical project Fil de Fer (FdF) consists in creating a C program that displays a graphical representation of a land mass. The program takes as first argument a path to a file which contains topography data.

##

A map for the project FdF is a simple text file based on the standard  [*ARC/INFO Grid Format*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esri_grid) whose headers are removed.

##
Line drawing, projection, camera movements and color handling were all done from scratch.
